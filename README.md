PlayBay
</b></h1>

PlayBay is a site centered on the PlayStation® gaming console. 

The purpose of the site is to provide a place where people interested in PlayStation® can read and post entries ranging from news to group plays, interact with other users and act as a hub solely dedicated to the console. 

It is designed to look and feel similar to the PlayStation® 5 brand and console.

Users can register an account to access full CRUD functionality for posting on the site.
