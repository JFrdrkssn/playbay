PlayBay
</b></h1>

PlayBay is a site centered on the PlayStation® gaming console. 

The purpose of the site is to provide a place where people interested in PlayStation® can read and post entries ranging from news to group plays, interact with other users and act as a hub solely dedicated to the console. 

It is designed to look and feel similar to the PlayStation® 5 brand and console.

Users can register an account to access full CRUD functionality for posting on the site.

## **Design**

- **Color Scheme**

  - A white background coupled with shades of blue, gold and grey provides clear contrast that is also easy on the eyes. It matches the aesthetic profile of the PlayStation® 5 console, giving a clear connection between the two.
  - The navigation bar and footer of the site has a sharper white, providing a very slight contrast to the main contents of the site.
  - Images for posts can be uploaded by a user, therefore the prominent white color coupled mostly with blue helps create a neutral background for images of any composition.
  - Some smaller elements are gold. In the world of PlayStation®, the gold/yellow color scheme is part of a special subscription model, and provide a great contrast to the white and blue colors that are part of the core brand color scheme.

- **Typography**

  - The Play font is used for the site logo. The font has a modern and sleek look while also reminding of the font used by the PlayStation® brand itself.
  - The Poppins font is used everywhere else on the site. It is clear, sleek and provide a good separation between characters, making it easy to read and blending in well.
  - Sans-serif is used as a backup-font.
